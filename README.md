# Telemetry for Art of Rally

Not affiliated with the Art of Rally game

This repository hosts Python tools to process a video recording of an Art of
Rally game and turn it into an automated telemetry system.

The telemetry is inspired by Formula 1 telemetry plotting speed along various
points in the track. My hope is to recreate this type of telemetry (speed vs
track position) in a visual style that complements the Art of Rally game style.
